# Goal
The goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of 3D graphics programming.

# Dependencies
- PDCurses

# How to Use
**Only for Windows**

The program requires two arguments: a path to a .obj 3D model and a read mode. The read mode can be `old` or `new`, depending on the type of the 3D file. `old` is used for files that define polygons, while `new` uses quads.
Example: ./Graphics.exe suzanne.obj new
